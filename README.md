📝 Final Report – Flipkart Data Analysis Project


---

🚌 Project Title

Transportation Analytics System for Fleet Fuel Efficiency, Route Costing, and Delay Insights


---

🎯 Objective:

To analyze transportation and traffic data by integrating multiple datasets, performing exploratory data analysis, and building interactive dashboards to evaluate vehicle efficiency, driver performance, route effectiveness, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs for data-driven operational optimization.

---

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python – Used for data cleaning, data merging, analysis, and report generation.
pandas – Used to process, clean, and merge structured datasets efficiently.
NumPy – Used for numerical calculations and data simulation.
matplotlib – Used to create basic visualizations during exploratory data analysis.
seaborn – Used for statistical and comparative visual analysis.
Google Colab – Used to write, run, and share Python notebooks.
Power BI Desktop – Used to build interactive dashboards and performance visualizations.
Microsoft Excel (openpyxl) – Used to export cleaned datasets in Excel format.
GitHub – Used to store project files, code, and final submissions.

📂 Data Sources Used

vehicles.csv – Contains vehicle details such as vehicle type and mileage.
drivers.csv – Contains driver information including experience level.
trips.csv – Contains trip-level data such as distance, route type, traffic level, delays, and fuel consumption.
maintenance.csv – Contains vehicle maintenance cost details.
📌 These datasets were used as raw inputs and later merged to create a unified master analytics table.
🏷️Note: All datasets are synthetically generated for academic and analytical purposes.


---


🧹 Data Preparation & Processing

The raw datasets were kept unchanged to maintain data integrity.
Data cleaning was performed on copied datasets to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Relevant tables were merged to create a unified master analytics table named "Transaction_Master_Analytics_Table.csv".
New analytical fields were created to support route cost and efficiency analysis.


---

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand traffic patterns, vehicle usage, and operational efficiency before building dashboards.

---

🔑 Key Analysis: Route Cost & Fuel Efficiency

This analysis focused on optimizing operational efficiency by evaluating fuel consumption, route performance, and costs per trip.

---


📈 Dashboards & Visualizations

1.Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI Desktop to visualize the insights from the master analytics table. These dashboards help decision-makers quickly understand vehicle, driver, and route performance.
2.Interactive Power BI .pbix file is included for reviewers to explore the dashboards.

💻 How to Run This Project:

1️⃣ Python & Notebook Execution
Upload .ipynb files in the Source_Code/ folder to Google Colab or VS Code Jupyter Notebook.
Run the notebooks sequentially from top to bottom to generate cleaned datasets, master analytics table, and charts.

2️⃣ Required Python Libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl

3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
Open PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix using Power BI Desktop (no sign-in required).
Explore interactive dashboards or export as PDF using:
File → Export → Export to PDF
